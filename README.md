# IITB RISC Computing System

## Overview
This repository contains the design and implementation of a **16-bit RISC-based computing system** developed as part of the **Digital Systems** course project at **IIT Bombay** under the guidance of **Prof. Virendra Singh**.

## Project Details
- Designed a **16-bit computing system** with **16-bit registers** and **64-kB RAM**.
- Implemented support for **14 different instructions**, covering arithmetic, logical, memory, and control operations.
- Created a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** with **11 executable states**, optimizing state equivalence to reduce complexity by **40%**.
- Developed key components like **ALU, instruction memory, register file, and data path** in **VHDL**.
- Created a **Testbench and debugging scripts** for validation and performance evaluation.
